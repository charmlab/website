  <h4>Bio</h4>
  <p>
    Dr. Amir-Hossein Karimi is an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering" target="_blank">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> with cross-appointment at the <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">Cheriton School of Computer Science of the University of Waterloo</a> at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a>, and a <a href="https://vectorinstitute.ai/" target="_blank">Vector Institute</a> Faculty Affiliate.

    He leads the <b>Collaborative Human-AI Reasoning Machines (‚ú®CHARM‚ú®) Lab</b>, dedicated to pioneering advances in AI to facilitate trustworthy human-AI collaborations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dr. Karimi's scholarly contributions have been showcased almost exclusively at top-tier AI and ML venues including <b>NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, AISTATS, ACM FAccT,</b> and <b>ACM AIES</b>. He has authored influential publications such as a comprehensive survey paper in the prestigious <b>ACM Computing Surveys</b>, holds a patent, and is a contributing author of a book chapter.

    Dr. Karimi‚Äôs work on algorithmic recourse has notably elevated its prominence in responsible AI research, with its presence growing from almost none to hundreds on Google Scholar in just five years; algorithmic recourse is now a mandatory criterion in key sectors, including <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32592" target="_blank">Canada‚Äôs Treasury Board Directive on Automated Decision-Making</a>.

    Several of Dr. Karimi's papers have received over 100 citations each. Dedicated to knowledge mobilization and reproducibility, his <a href="https://github.com/charmlab" target="_blank">open-source code</a> has garnered over 100 GitHub stars.

  <p>

    <!-- Besides highlighted presentations at the aforementioned venues and serving on their respective conference program committees, numerous academic and industry research labs have invited Dr. Karimi to present talks, lectures, and tutorials. His invited talks span institutions like University College London, ETH Zurich, Cyber Valley Health, Harvard University, MIT, Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA), Institute of Mathematical Statistics, NEC Europe Labs, DeepMind, and Google Brain. Notably, Dr. Karimi gave a tutorial on Causal Explainable AI at KDD 2023 and one on Algorithmic Recourse at the Toronto ML Summit 2024. 

    Dr. Karimi is a firm believer in the strength of diverse perspectives and is dedicated to building inclusive spaces in academia and beyond.

    As a professor, he strives to inspire the next generation of AI researchers and engineers, helping them understand and responsibly apply the power of AI.

    Further emphasizing his commitment to inclusive learning, he co-founded "<a href="https://instagram.com/princeofai/" target="_blank">Prince of AI</a>," an initiative that provides free education on basic and advanced AI topics to a community of over 30,000 individuals.

    This initiative aims to reduce barriers to education and offer opportunities to those who traditionally lack access. With a wealth of content equivalent to an introductory ML course, their platform facilitates active learning through technical posts, engaging video reels, and interactive webinars. -->

  <h4>‚ú®CHARM Lab‚ú®</h4>
  <p>
    The mandate of the <b>Collaborative Human-AI Reasoning Machines (‚ú®CHARM‚ú®) Lab</b> is to enhance the integration of AI systems into human decision-making, ensuring they are not only <b>powerful</b> but also <b>safe</b>, <b>reliable</b>, and <b>aligned</b> with human values.

    As AI becomes more embedded in everyday life, e.g., üè• healthcare, üéì education, üíº finance, and üöó transportation, our dependency on these systems grows, and so does the risk of potential consequential errors.

    Our mission is to develop AI systems that can <b>detect</b> üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è potential issues, <b>correct</b> üõ†Ô∏è mistakes, and ultimately <b>perfect</b> ü§ù human-AI partnership where humans and machines work together seamlessly to achieve better outcomes. üåç‚ú®
  </p>

  <p>
    The CHARM Lab focuses on <u>causal inference</u>, <u>explainable AI</u>, and <u>neuro-symbolic</u> approaches in order to build systems that allow users to <b>understand</b>, <b>challenge</b>, and <b>improve</b> AI decisions.

    We occasionally also borrow insights from, and collaborate with leading experts in, such fields as <u>social sciences</u>, <u>cognitive science</u>, <u>human-computer interaction</u>, <u>multi-agent reinforcement learning</u>, <u>game theory</u>, and <u>behavioral economics</u>.
